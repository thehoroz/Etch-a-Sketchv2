**INFO**
The Etch-a-Sketch project.

With this project, we create a basic sketch pad.

We had our focus on loops, event listeners and dom manipulation. We had to create a grid, in which an amount of cells are generated according to user input. The generated cells have to change color with a mouse hover.
